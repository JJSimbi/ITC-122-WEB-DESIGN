        <!--Sonnett-->
        If thou must love me, let it be for nought <br>
        Except for love's sake only. Do not say, <br>
        "I love her for her smile—her look—her way <br>
        Of speaking gently,—for a trick of thought <br>
        That falls in well with mine, and certes brought <br>
        A sense of pleasant ease on such a day"— <br>
        For these things in themselves, Belovèd, may <br>
        Be changed, or change for thee—and love, so wrought, <br>
        May be unwrought so. Neither love me for <br>
        Thine own dear pity's wiping my cheeks dry: <br>
        A creature might forget to weep, who bore <br>
        Thy comfort long, and lose thy love thereby! <br>
        But love me for love's sake, that evermore <br>
        Thou mayst love on, through love's eternity.
